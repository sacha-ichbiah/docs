### How does the AI model work?



Our AI models are trained on a substantial volume of logistics and supply chain-related data. They are adept at handling a wide array of tasks, from interpreting complex logistical documents to extracting key information to streamline manual data entry. Key to our AI's effectiveness is the continuous enhancement process. With each update and re-training cycle, the models grow more proficient in deciphering a variety of document types, languages, and industry-specific terminologies. 

Large language models (LLMs) form the foundation of our technology. While LLMs can sometimes be prone to errors or generating inaccurate data, our approach mitigates these challenges. We employ a technique known as guided generation, which strategically constraints LLMs to produce data in a structured, predefined format. This method significantly reduces the likelihood of random errors and ensures the reliability of the output, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the data crucial for effective supply chain management.

At Cube, we are committed to evolving our AI capabilities to meet the dynamic needs of the freight forwarding industry, ensuring that our clients always have access to the most efficient and accurate data processing tools.

### Signing up
You can sign up using the traditional method of email plus password or sign up using Google OAuth.

If you choose to sign up with your email, you will be asked to verify your email address before you can start using the service. Once you have verified your email, you will be taken to the Speech Synthesis page where you can immediately start using the service. Simply type anything into the box and press “generate” to convert the text into voiceover narration. Please note that each time you press “generate” anywhere on the website, it will count towards your quota.

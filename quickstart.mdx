## Overview

Integrating Cube in your application can be done in two ways. Either you use our API to send documents and receive data, or you install the outlook plugin to send documents when processing emails. The Cube Outlook plugin is designed to analyze the body content and attachments of emails, process them, and format the data into a standard format suitable for insertion into a transportation management system (TMS).
